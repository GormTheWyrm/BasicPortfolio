                As you can probably tell, I am a medieval enthusiast who likes to participate in various medieval
                activities
                such as the events run by the <a href="https://www.sca.org/" target="_blank">Society of Creative
                    Anachronism.</a>
                Unsurprisingly, I am also a huge fan of medieval fantasy and similarly themed filk, bardic and folk
                music.
                My other hobbies include sailing, rowing, hiking, swordplay, bonfires and carrying loot on long
                beachside journeys.
            </p>

            <h5><em>At the time of this writing the SCA website is down, but eventually you should be able to see local
                    events
                    at <a href="http://atlantia.sca.org/calendar.php" target="_blank">the Atlantian Calandar of
                        Events.</em></a>
            </h5>

            <p>
                Recently I enrolled at the University of Richmond for a Web Development Bootcamp.
                As an aspiring digital creator I spend a lot of my free time learning about Game Design,
                Story Structure, and Medieval Societies.
                I am also working on an elaborate fantasy setting for a piece of creative fiction.
                Hopefully that will be established as the setting for a series of games or novels sometime in the
                future.
                <br> <br>
                To the horror of all, I have also begun to poke around the idea of using blender for 3D modeling.
                I am nearly skilled enough to create an egg.

                If you are reading this because you are looking to hire me,
                feel free to believe that I merely forgot to change this after posting it for a school assignment.
                It could be true.

                When I am not raiding I can be found by hitting the <a href="contact.html" target="_blank"> Contact </a>
                button.
                <br>
                Or you can try smoke signals.
