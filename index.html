            As you can probably tell, I am a medieval enthusiast who likes to participate in various medieval activities
            such as the events run by the <a href="www.sca.org" target="_blank">Society of Creation Anachronism.</a>
            Unsurprisingly, I am also a huge fan of medieval fantasy and similarly themed filk and folk music.
            My other hobbies include sailing, rowing, hiking, swordplay, bonfires and carrying loot on long beachside
            journeys.

        <h5><em>At the time of this writing the SCA website is down, but eventually you should be able to see local
                events
                at <a href="http://atlantia.sca.org/calendar.php" target="_blank">the Atlantian Calandar of
                    Events.</em></a>
        </h5>

            Recently I enrolled at the University of Richmond for a Web Development Bootcamp.
            As an aspiring digital creator I spend a lot of my free time learning about Game Design,
            Story Structure, and Medieval Societies.
            I am also working on an elaborate fantasy setting for a piece of creative fiction.
            Hopefully that will be established as the setting for a series of games or novels sometime in the future.
            <br> <br>
            To the horror of all, I have also begun to poke around the idea of using blender for 3D modeling.
            I am nearly skilled enough to create an egg.

            If you are reading this because you are looking to hire me,
            feel free to believe that I merely forgot to change this after posting it for a school assignment.
            It could be true.

            When I am not raiding I can be found by hitting the <a href="contact.html" target="_blank"> Contact </a>
            button.

            Or you can try smoke signals.
